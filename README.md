# DevSwarm: Speed without Sacrifice

DevSwarm is a desktop-based Augmented Development Environment (ADE) that lets you **run multiple coding assistants in parallel**, each on its own branch, with clean diffs and a fast review loop. Bring your favorite CLI coding assistant and tools, and even run local. Keep your workflow. Ship faster without sacrificing quality.

We're all about High Velocity Engineering: the art of moving fast while building right.

- Parallel builders for focused tasks
- Branch isolation with clean diffs and reviews
- Bring your own coding agent and tools
- Team visibility and repeatable workflows
- Built for security, performance, and control

# DevSwarm ‚Äî AI Development Environment for Parallel Coding

DevSwarm is an AI Development Environment (ADE) for parallel coding with multiple assistants. Run Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Amazon Q, or local agents/LLMs side by side. Each assistant works on its own Git branch so you get clean diffs, fast reviews, sandboxed experimentation. Keep your editor and tools, while using the CLI you already know. DevSwarm coordinates focused ‚Äúbuilders‚Äù to handle tasks in parallel, from refactors to tests to docs, then helps you compare and merge with confidence. Built for coder in the loop, not vibe coding. Works on desktop for speed and control. If you want to move fast while building right, DevSwarm gives you parallel AI workflows without changing how you ship.

We're all about High Velocity Engineering: the art of moving fast and making things.

- Parallel builders for focused tasks
- Branch isolation with clean diffs and reviews
- Bring your own coding agent and tools
- Team visibility and repeatable workflows
- Built for security, performance, and control

## Why DevSwarm
Most tools stick AI inside your editor. DevSwarm is the foundation for parallel, developer-first AI coding. Run multiple assistants, compare branches, and stay in control of your code.
